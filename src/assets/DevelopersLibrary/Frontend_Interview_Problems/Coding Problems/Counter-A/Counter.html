<!-- // This is a short question which only requires one state variable, which is the number of times the button has been clicked (count). Attach a 'click' event listener to the <button> and each time it is clicked, increment the count value and update the text with that value.

// Since only the count needs to change, we can use a <span> to target the count text and update its textContent whenever a click event is fired.

// Test Cases
// Click on the counter to increment the count value by one.
