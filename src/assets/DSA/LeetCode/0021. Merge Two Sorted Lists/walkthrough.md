## Merge Two Sorted Lists WALKTHROUGH

Steps
- [ ] Check if any of the lists is empty.
- [ ] Determine the head of the resultant list. This head will be the smaller of the heads of the given lists.
- [ ] Loop through each node of the lists until one of the lists get traversed completely.
- [ ] While traversing the lists, identify smaller of the nodes of the lists and add it to the resultant list.
- [ ] Once the loop is complete, there may be a case where a list has nodes remaining. We will add those remaining nodes to the resultant list.
